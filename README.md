#### Audience: Senior Leaders and HR Professionals   
**Description:** This comprehensive dashboard delivers real-time, actionable insights into workforce trends, providing leaders with the tools needed to make informed, data-driven decisions on staffing, attrition, and workforce planning. By visualizing key metrics such as attrition rates, department-level breakdowns, and workforce demographics, decision-makers can pinpoint opportunities for improving employee retention, managing headcount, and aligning resources with organizational goals.

**KPI Analysis:** The dashboard's KPI section offers a dynamic overview of essential staffing metrics, including current employee count, attrition rates, and average employee age. This high-level analysis is supported by visualizations that facilitate the tracking of workforce trends against strategic targets, ensuring optimal alignment with the companyâ€™s overall human capital objectives. By providing a clear picture of employee engagement and turnover, this tool enables leadership to optimize resource allocation, enhance job satisfaction, and promote data-driven workforce strategies.

## Python Projects
Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.addmyfile)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
